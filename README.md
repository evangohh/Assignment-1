Summer Salt Band 

Immersing myself in the world of Summer Salt, I've dedicated time to crafting a prototype website tailored to the needs of fellow fans like me. With a dual focus on mobile and desktop compatibility, this website is designed to offer a seamless experience for enthusiasts eager to engage with Summer Salt. The user-friendly interface beckons fans to explore and effortlessly make purchases, whether it's snagging the latest merchandise or securing tickets for the band's upcoming concerts.

One of the standout features of the website is its intuitive design. A streamlined navigation experience awaits users with a dropdown menu, ensuring quick and easy access to various sections. The addition of an 'Add to Cart' function, activated with a simple click on the merchandise images, adds a layer of convenience for fans looking to build their collection. This design philosophy not only simplifies the buying process but also enhances accessibility to essential pages like the tour schedule and band history, creating a space where fans can seamlessly connect with the heart of Summer Salt.


Design Process

Designing the Summer Salt website was a passionate endeavor rooted in a deep understanding of the band's diverse fanbase. Recognizing that fans seek more than just music, the primary goal was to create an immersive online space that caters to their desires. The target audience includes avid Summer Salt enthusiasts, eager to not only stay connected with the band but also purchase merchandise and secure tickets for their concerts.

This website is crafted as a one-stop hub for fans to fulfill their desires â€“ whether it's staying updated on tour dates, learning more about the band's history, or proudly donning the latest merchandise. By focusing on user-centric design and anticipating the needs and wants of the Summer Salt community, this project aims to be the optimal platform for fans to engage with and support their favorite band.

As a music enthusiast, I want to easily navigate the website on both my desktop and mobile devices, so that I can stay connected with Summer Salt wherever I am.

Being a fan looking for the latest merchandise, I want to be able to browse through available items with a simple click on images, so that I can quickly add them to my cart and make a purchase.

Lastly as a concert-goer, I want to access the tour page with just a few clicks, so that I can stay informed about upcoming events and plan accordingly.
